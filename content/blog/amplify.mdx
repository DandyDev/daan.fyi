Have you ever gone above and beyond to give a product a fair chance, only giving up way past your
own sanity and patience? I did. The product was [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)

## Let's build something with NextJS

When I started developing the primary (web) UI for the product we're building at
[Source](https:/source.ag), I quickly decided to use the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework as
the basis for the frontend. One thing I really like about NextJS is that it does [filesystem-based
routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages). Even though I like to diss on PHP as much
as the next person, this particular feature of NextJS reminds me a bit of PHP _in a good way_.

Another very compelling feature of NextJS, is the ability to have different rendering strategies
for each different page. You can decide to use:

- [Static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended)
  for pages and content that rarely change. These pages get pre-rendered at build time and can be
  aggressively cached on a CDN.
  These pages can of-course still be highly dynamic by using client-side data fetching methods
- [Server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) for
  pages that need to return different content on each request and/or for each different user
- [Incremental static regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration),
  which is a variation on Static generation that will cache pages for a period you specify and then
  regenerate the pages server-side when they're considered stale

## Deployment

This particular feature requires a specific hosting setup that supports the different _flavours_
of rendering. You basically want:

- a good CDN to cache and serve your static pages
- a server-side solution to serve the server-side rendered pages and facilitate incremental static
  regeneration. This should also take care of
  [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), should you use them

The NextJS documentation [mentions a couple of options](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for
deployment:

1. Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Vercel is the company behind NextJS. They offer a seamless
   experience where you can use any rendering method, and Vercel will deploy each part of your app
   in the right way. One neat thing they do is that they'll convert your server-side rendered pages
   and API routes into serverless functions that they'll deploy to edge locations all over the globe.
2. Setup a NodeJS server somewhere for the server-side stuff and use a CDN manually to serve the
   static content.

At Source however, we've made a conscious decision to use AWS for all of our infrastructure needs. We're
too early in the lifecycle of both our product and company to consider a hybrid cloud setup and
AWS offers all the features that we need for prices that are reasonable _for now_. Through one of
our investors we also got a boat-load of AWS credits to get started, which helps.

## Amplify

I didn't want to manually set up a hybrid deployment with NodeJS and CDN - which I could probably do
using Cloudfront and ECS - so I looked for alternatives. AWS Amplify claims to be the

> Fastest, easiest way to build mobile and web apps that scale

And they [claim to support NextJS](https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/)
as well as [server-side rendering](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/host-a-next-js-ssr-app-with-real-time-data-on-aws-amplify/)
by virtue of [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/)

Sounds great! So how does that all work?

## Amplify - the setup

The idea behind Amplify is that it lets you focus on building your app without having to worry
about the infrastructure. This means that it will not only let you build and deploy your frontend
easily, it will also let you hook-up backend components like
[authentication](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/) through
[Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/),
a [GraphQL API](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started/q/platform/js/) using
[AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)
and a [DataStore](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js/).

The way Amplify manages all of this, is through the idea of "backends". A backend contains one or
more of the aforementioned components. You can setup different backend environments in Amplify and
couple these to different (git) branches of your frontend.

## Amplify - the developer experience

We are bringing our own database and API and wanted to use a pre-existing Cognito user pool.
Amplify lets you import an existing Cognito user pool instead of creating one for you, and this
worked fine... until I tried to create a second "backend environment" with a different Cognito
user pool.

I want to allow different users on our development environment than our production
environment. These environments correspond to the `main` branch in Git (production) and any other
branches in Git (development).

#### How do I tie an Amplify backend environment to a frontend branch?

Interaction with Amplify is done through the web console or the
[Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/). According to the documentation, we can create a new
Amplify backend environment like this:

```
amplify env add
```

But nowhere is it made clear how this is linked to our frontend branch. The Amplify CLI tries to
mimic the `git` CLI by having `amplify push` and `amplify pull`. So I assume we need to `push` our
new environment to the cloud. Does this command depend on the git branch I'm on? I don't know.
I could just as easily overwrite my existing backend environment when using this command.

Eventually I was able to create a `main` environment and a `dev` environment, but no matter how hard
I tried, I could not get those environments to use different Cognito user pools.

#### How do new team members setup an existing project?

The Amplify CLI will create some configuration files, some of which you need to commit to git, and
some of them you need to ignore. These files should make the build reproducible. It is unclear
however, what a new developer needs to do to be able to run an existing Amplify project.
The documentation mentions multiple Amplify CLI commands to setup a project:

```
amplify pull
```

```
amplify init
```

```
amplify configure project
```

```
amplify env checkout <my-env>
```

_To be run in arbitrary order?_

on StackOverflow give 3 different answers on this topic.

When I was on-boarding new team-members, we basically tried some commands in different order until
we were able to run the project locally for that engineer.

#### How do I figure out why my build failed?

In short: [you don't](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-console/issues/2065). Or you enlist
the help of AWS Support (which you will have to pay for). The Amplify web console doesn't share
detailed build logs, so you'll have to fix your problems by trial and error.

## Amplify - the bugs

AWS Amplify seems to have quite some bugs. For example: when you use Gitlab, you
cannot put the source code of your project
[in a sub-group](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-console/issues/1941). This will silently
fail your build, with no clear error message in sight.

The aforementioned problem of using multiple Cognito user pools for different
environments of one Amplify frontend, I also consider a bug.

Not having access to the _actual_ build logs, I also consider a bug.

## Amplify - no help included

The most painful issue I have with AWS Amplify - and AWS in general - is the complete lack of
support. You are paying a lot of money for their services, but that does not come with any form of
support, unless you pay extra. And when you make use of that paid support, it goes something like
this:

1. Contact AWS Business support through their website and try to explain your problem in a plain
text field that you cannot resize or use formatting in
2. Wait far longer than the promised 4 hours
3. Get a response from someone telling you they'll forward it to "the team" (why not have someone
respond who can actually help you with your problem?)
4. Get a canned response with a solution akin to "turn it off and on again"
5. Tell them you have an *actual problem*
6. Get forwarded to the next person who you have to clue in again on what your problem is
7. Go to 2 and repeat

This means that in practice, AWS Amplify is *not usable* unless you are willing to pay extra for
support and have a lot of patience.

As a side note, I find it really frustrating that with big corporations like Amazon in general, you
quickly feel helpless and ignored when you have problems. Stories about Google customer support (or
lack thereof) are rampant on Hacker News, and I think Amazon is no different. You'd think that with
so much revenue they should be able to set up actual proper customer support ðŸ™„

## The Pattern with AWS

I think that these problems with Amplify are endemic of a larger problem with AWS: **their PaaS and
SaaS solutions suck**. Aside from pricing (which is quite high compared to competitors like
Digital Ocean), I think AWS' infrastructure-as-a-service offerings are fine. If you want to have a
bunch of servers (EC2), a database here and there (RDS) and some serverless functions (Lambda), AWS
will serve you just fine.

But if you want something on top of that, like authentication (Cognito), or a PaaS solution like
Amplify, be prepared for a sub-par offering compared to the competition. I think Amazon should
focus on strengthening their core offerings instead of offering everything and the kitchen sink.

## The solution

In the end, I dropped Amplify and went with Vercel. $20/user/month is a small price to pay for
actually being able to work on the product instead of fighting AWS services and support.
