summary: "RSS is an important feature to give your content maximum exposure while also retaining control over your content. This post shows how to add syndication feeds to a statically generated NextJS site"
---
Today, I released a new version of my website with only one new feature:
[syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication) through RSS, Atom and JSON Feed. Even
though [by some accounts](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/), RSS
[seems to be dead](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/12/26/apple-news-no-longer-supports-rss/),
I strongly believe RSS is an important feature in the fight to keep ownership over your own content
while also increasing exposure. The way I approach publishing and sharing my content, is called
[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE):

> **Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere**.

RSS is an important part of that strategy.

Luckily, I'm not the only one who values RSS. [There](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20813021)
[are](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23212812) [others](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26014344)

In this article I want to share how I implemented syndication feeds in my
[NextJS-powered](https://nextjs.org/) website.

## Options and Requirements

I did some Googling to see how other NextJS users were generating RSS feeds, and there turned out
to be many people that had solved this particular problem [and wrote about it](https://www.google.com/search?q=rss+feed+nextjs)
I found a couple of different approaches to generating and rendering RSS feeds in NextJS:

**Generating feeds**:

- Hand-build the required XML using templated strings ü§¢
- Use a library to do it for you. The most popular library for this in the JS ecosystem seems to be
  [_feed_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) ü§©

**Rendering feeds**:

- Use [Server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering)
  - Advantages:
    - Create dynamic feeds (more on that later) that can be different for each visitor
    - Using NextJS pages to represent feeds feels natural in the NextJS way of doing things
  - Disadvantages:
    - You can't generate the website statically anymore (at least parts of it remain dynamic),
      which reduces performance
  As a side note: from a development perspective, server-side rendered pages and statically generated
  pages in NextJS are so similar that the difference doesn't matter
- Use [Static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation)
  - Advantages:
    - Because the feeds are generated at build time, the site remains snappy
  - Disadvantages
    - You cannot set the `Content-Type` header for statically generated pages, so you can't serve
      those pages as `application/rss+xml`. I'm not how big of a problem this is and what black
      magic [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) applies when serving my NextJS site


### Picking the requirements

After looking at the options, I decided on the following requirements for my feeds:

- I want to go for statically generated feeds, to keep my site fast and the implementation simple
- Support for [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS),
  [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) and [JSON Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/)
- I want to include the **complete blog post contents** in the feeds. This is an important one
  because I personally really hate it when my RSS reader only shows me a summary of a post and
  I have to go the the website to read all of it.
  Caveat though: my website is built using MDX, so I might include components in the future
  that are not easily convertible to static HTML without Javascript enabled. In that case,
  readers will have to click through to my site.

## Implementation

As per my requirements, I wanted to generate the feeds at build time. But as mentioned before,
NextJS doesn't support setting the `Content-Type` header for statically generated pages.
The alternative that many people use, is to have a separate script generate your feeds and
writing them to the public folder where all other static assets such as images are stored as well.
That way, the feeds would be served as static assets instead of statically generated pages -- which,
from the browsers perspective doesn't make a difference!

I found a [good explanation by Ashlee Boyer](https://ashleemboyer.com/how-i-added-an-rss-feed-to-my-nextjs-site)
of this technique.

My plan:

1. Write script to generate feeds, using the _feed_ library from NPM
2. Run this script as a `postbuild` step so it would always be invoked after building the site
   using `npm run build` (this happens not only locally, but also when Vercel deploys my site)

### Problem 1: running Typescript modules is hard

I immediately hit a snag with (1), because I couldn't manage to use ES6/Typescript modules in a
script run outside of my normal website code. I'm using Typescript, and apparently `ts-node`, the
tool to run Typescript files, doesn't support modules. Writing the script in Javascript wasn't
really an option for me because I wanted to reuse a lot of logic that I already wrote for reading
and parsing MDX files.

#### Solution

I decided to follow the route that Ashlee Boyer suggests in her blog post and sneak in the
function to generate my feeds as a "stowaway" in the `getStaticProps` function of my index
page. This works beautifully!

```typescript:pages/index.tsx
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = () => {
    generateMainFeeds();
    const lastPosts = getAllPostsFrontMatter('blog', 3);
    return {
        props: {
            lastPosts,
        },
    };
};
```

### Problem 2: including the full content in the feeds

The code of my website already supported translating MDX files into valid JSX to be rendered
by React. But how to generate valid HTML from that content and include it in the feeds?

#### Solution

I couldn't find many examples of this, but did find out about
[`ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostaticmarkup).
This function will take a bunch of React components and render them in to HTML. This is what is
used by many React server-side rendering solutions _(maybe also by NextJS?)_ and works perfectly
here as well.

One caveat: if your content contains internal links -- which are often relative links -- then you
have to be mindful that those relative links are meaningless in the context of an RSS feed.
The way I solved this is by doing some regex-based replacements on the generated HTML.

The complete content generation part looks like this:

```typescript:lib/feeds.tsx
const url = `${baseUrl}/blog/${post.frontMatter.slug}`;
const htmlContent = ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(
    <ChakraProvider resetCSS theme={theme}>
        <MDXRemote {...post.mdxSource} components={MDXComponents} />
    </ChakraProvider>
    .replace(/href="\/#/g, `href="${url}#`)
    .replace(/href="\//g, `href="${baseUrl}/`)
    .replace(/src="\//g, `src="${baseUrl}/`);
)
```


### Problem 3: getting rid of style information

My site uses [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for themeing, which will happily render tons
of `<style>` tags when statically generating HTML from your React components. For most use cases
where you render React on the server (statically or not), this is desirable. In the case of
RSS/Atom feeds, this is pretty useless.

#### Solution

The solution here is to strip all the `<script>` and `<style>` tags from the generated HTML.
Rather than summoning
[_The One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane_](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/872397)
by trying to use regex here, I found [this library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-strip-html)
to help me with this task:

```typescript:lib/feeds.tsx
const cleanHtmlContent = stripHtml(htmlContent, {
    onlyStripTags: ['script', 'style'],
    stripTogetherWithTheirContents: ['script', 'style'],
}).result;
```

## The end result

I now have serve [RSS](/feeds/feed.xml), [Atom](/feeds/atom.xml) and a [JSON Feed](/feeds/feed.json)
for your reading pleasure. Most of the relevant code [can be found here](https://github.com/DandyDev/daan.fyi/blob/main/lib/feeds.tsx)

## Future plans

At some point I want to diversify my writing output by not only writing about tech. And
even within the topic of tech there are many sub-topics I could write about, not all of which
are equally interesting to every reader (all 5 of them, including my mom üë©‚Äçüë¶).
I'm planning to introduce [tags](https://github.com/DandyDev/daan.fyi/issues/3) to allow
filtering content once I have enough of it.

Once I have tags, I would like to start supporting dynamic feeds so readers can subscribe only
to the stuff they actually want to read. I imagine building an endpoint like this:

```
/feeds/by-tags.xml?tags=tag1,tag2
```

I'm curious if others are doing this!
