I use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage different Python versions on my laptop. It
also comes with an [official plugin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) that lets you manage
_virtualenvs_ through pyenv, which I find very convenient. Basically, virtualenvs are treated as
just different Python versions by pyenv.

One thing that bothered me is that, whenever I create a new virtualenv and use `pip` in it, I am
inevitably greeted by a message telling me `pip` is out-of-date:

```
WARNING: You are using pip version 21.2.3; however, version 21.3.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the '~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0/envs/test/bin/python3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

So I end up always having to upgrade pip after creating a new virtualenv. Wouldn't it be nice if
this could be automated?

Turns out, we actually _can_ by leveraging [_pyenv hooks_](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins#pyenv-hooks).

## pyenv hooks

pyenv hooks are scripts that are executed by pyenv whenever certain commands are run. These can be
regular pyenv commands like `pyenv install` or `pyenv rehash` for example. But what is not
apparent from the pyenv documentation, is that you can also create hooks for plugins, like
`pyenv virtualenv`.

You can create a hook by creating a script at the following location:

```bash
$PYENV_ROOT/pyenv.d/<hook-name>/<whatever>.bash
```

`hook-name` here can be any of: `exec`, `rehash`, `which`, `install` -- which are all regular pyenv
commands -- but it can also be a plugin command, like `virtualenv`. The filename of the script doesn't
matter, and neither does the extension. I use `.bash` here to make it explicit that this is a bash
script, but pyenv hooks can be written in any language.

To create a hook that upgrades `pip` and some other default packages, you can create a new script
as follows:

```bash
mkdir -p $PYENV_ROOT/pyenv.d/virtualenv/
$EDITOR $PYENV_ROOT/pyenv.d/virtualenv/after.bash
```

Where `$EDITOR` is your favorite editor (like `vim`, **RIGHT?!**)

Then add the following contents:

```bash
after_virtualenv 'PYENV_VERSION="$VIRTUALENV_NAME" pyenv-exec pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel'
```

`after_virtualenv` is the command that tells pyenv _when_ to execute the following command. In this
case its defined by the `pyenv virtualenv` plugin. First we set the pyenv version to the name
of the virtualenv we just created. This is set by pyenv virtualenv as `$VIRTUALENV_NAME`. Then we
install/upgrade `pip` itself and `setuptools` and `wheel`.

That is all there is to it! Now any time you create a new virtualenv using `pyenv virtualenv`, the
aforementioned packages will be automatically upgraded after the virtualenv was created.
