A couple of weeks ago someone shared
[an article](https://alexander-hansen.dev/blog/benefits-of-not-using-an-ide) on Hacker News that
discussed the drawbacks of using an IDE for programming. Needless to say, when you touch
people's tools, you can be sure to
[spark a hefty discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28257116).

To be fair, the author did clarify that they're not against IDE's _in general_ and they actually
use one on a daily basis.

When reading the discussion, one of the first things I wondered is if there are places on the
internet where carpenters or plumbers furiously criticize each other's choice of tools.
But _even that_ has [a place on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28257382)

In this post I want to explore the fundamental problems with this type of discussion and how you
can embrace freedom of choice.

## It's all about context

When discussing someone else's choice of tools -- in this case the choice of editor or IDE -- it's
good to be mindful of what we _don't know_ about this person and their reasons for choosing certain
tools. Aside from personal preference and/or familiarity, there can be lots of extra factors to
consider:

- We don't know what kind of problems they're working on
- We don't know the context in which they work (e.g. security requirements laid down by the company
  they work for, available budget)
- We don't know their level of experience

I think it's good form to voice an opinion only when we can see the whole picture. I also
think that people should be encouraged to **choose the right tool for the job**. And to put it
simply: **the right tool for the job is the one that fits the problem and makes you the most
productive**.

## It's also about definition

Another issue with this kind of discussion is that everyone has a different idea of what really
constitutes an "IDE". We're inclined to frame the choice of editor as a binary choice -- "pure text
editor" vs "IDE", almost like a false dichotomy -- while it really is a spectrum. On this spectrum
you'll not only find different editors, but even different configurations of the same editor with
varying degrees of "smartness" applied through plugins.

So when someone says _"why use an IDE when you can do everything an IDE does in VIM if you install
the following 20 plugins"_, is this really so different from an actual IDE (that was branded as
such)?

## Philosophies in tool choices

When looking at how people setup their development environments, I basically see 2 different
approaches:

- The _"additive"_ approach: this basically follows the UNIX philosophy of composing many different
  tools that each do one thing well. It often involves a terminal-based editor like VIM, optionally
  with some plugins and supported by external tools like grep, sed and awk that can help with
  refactoring code. You basically stack tools until you have an "integrated" development environment
- The _"subtractive"_ approach: you take one "big" editor as the basis of your stack. This is often
  an editor that is branded as an IDE (e.g. Eclipse, Jetbrains editors). Then you take away/replace
  ("subtract") the parts that work better through dedicated tools (according to personal preference
  of course)

To me, both approaches have their merits and uses!

## How to create freedom of choice?

I think the most important question around editors is not
> _How to choose the right editor?_

but rather

> _How to enable each member of my team to choose the editor that makes them **most productive**,
> while enabling **effective collaboration**?_

Here's my recipe to do that:

My basic starting point in teams: _everyone can use the editor/IDE of their choice_. To enable
effective collaboration, the following rules must be followed:

- Editor configuration is never checked into version control, unless it's generic and
  [applicable across editors](https://editorconfig.org/). Examples of generic editor configuration
  are: line endings, tabs vs spaces, max line length etc. There is some overlap with linters here
- Enforce common code style through external tools (i.e. linters, code formatters)
- Everyone should be able to build and run a project, regardless of the choice of editor,
  preferably through the terminal. This means that we'll always prefer external tools for this.
  Many languages provide tooling for this:
  - Java â†’ Maven/Gradle
  - JS/TS â†’ NPM
  - Go â†’ Go
  - Rust â†’ Cargo
  - ...
- Additionally, building and running code can be made easier and better reproducible by using
  Makefiles and/or Docker (combined with Docker Compose)

I have to admit that in some ways I also limit choice within my teams: building and running
projects often involves shell scripts which are portable between Linux and MacOS, but not to
Windows. This can be solved by using WSL on Windows.

## This is my setup

My personal setup involves quite a lot of tools.

For any "serious" development work (i.e. long stretches of coding and big projects) I take the
aforementioned "subtractive" approach. My basis is one of the Jetbrains tools, depending on the
language(s) I'm working with. I find the Jetbrains tools make _me_ really productive and their
[_All products pack_](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/) offers great value for money, especially with
their huge loyalty discounts after 1 or more years.

I still use the terminal and external tools for many things in this case. I put quite some time in
improving and maintaining [my dotfiles](https://github.com/DandyDev/dotfiles) as well.

- I prefer to use the terminal for: building, linting, running tests, using git
- I prefer to use the IDE for: writing and editing code, refactoring, searching for code,
  find/replace through regex

For quick and short edits and viewing files where speed is preferred and conveniences like syntax
highlighting and intellisense are not important, I use Sublime Text or VIM. Example of this:
editing my dotfiles.

Sometimes, but rarely, I use VSCodium for editing or viewing files which are not part of a project
and which I want to reformat/reindent. This doesn't work well for me in Sublime Text. For example:
viewing/editing minified JSON files.

## Conclusion

To wrap this post up, I just want to reiterate: use whatever tools make you productive and help you
solve the problems you're trying to solve and please let others do the same.

And here's some additional closing advice: should you ever grow unhappy with the tools you're
using, just write a blog post extolling the virtues of your current tools. You can be sure people
on the internet will tell you how much better their tools are, thereby providing you with potential
alternatives to your current setup ðŸ˜‡
