All access management in AWS is done through [**AWS Identity and Access Management**](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
(or _IAM_ in short). IAM provides a way to configure _who_ can do _what_ in an AWS account.
The "who" in this case can be humans, machines/software or other AWS services.

IAM is quite complex and there are several concepts you need to understand in order to know how to
give people, software and machines the right access to the right resources in your AWS Accounts.
This can become complicated quite fast if you're managing multiple AWS Accounts with many different
resources and services, as explained in the [previous post in this series](/aws-multi-account).

In this blog post I'm going to attempt to explain the terminology in a clear and concise way. This
will help me personally as a kind of _cheat sheet_ for later recall and hopefully be of use to
others to whom these concepts are still new.

## Accounts and Resources

A **Resource** in AWS is basically any piece of infrastructure or any AWS service you can pay for
and use. This also represents the things you want to control access to. Some examples of this:
[**EC2**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) servers and [**S3**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets.

For all these resources, you can control who or what can access them and to what extent.

An **Account** in AWS is a container for resources. So it's **_not_ a representation of a human**
using AWS services. In that sense, it's quite different from the typical definition of an account
in online services like Twitter or Facebook, where accounts are digital extensions of human beings.

An AWS Account is used to **create, manage and pay for resources**. It can be similar to an
_environment_ or _project_, with servers, databases, S3 buckets etc.

Even though an account does not represent a user, it still has -- confusingly -- a unique email
address attached to it and a password to log in. This login represents the
[_AWS account root user_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html) of
an AWS account.

<SideNote title="AWS Account root users should not be regularly used!" type="danger">

You could use the AWS Account root user to do _anything_ you want in an AWS Account. It is a bad
habit to do so. This **root** user is basically the keys to the kingdom and as such, should be
locked away securely and not be used for everyday tasks.

Instead, you should create separate IAM and/or AWS SSO users for normal tasks, even for
administrator tasks.

</SideNote>

## Identities in AWS

So if _Accounts_ in AWS do not represent human users, how is **identity** established so that
access can be granted to resources in AWS Accounts?

This is done through **Users, Roles and Groups**. All three are a form of **Identity** in AWS.
An Identity is something that can be granted access to an AWS service or resource.

### IAM Users

An **IAM User** represents a human that can log into AWS and/or leverage the AWS API to use
AWS services and access resources on AWS. An IAM User has 2 sets of credentials:

- **Username/Password**: used to log into the web-based [_AWS Management Console_](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
- **Access Key/Access Key Secret**: used to access AWS programmatically through the API and/or command line

Two key things to understand about IAM users:

- a regular IAM User does **not** have an email address attached to it
- IAM Users are created _within a single AWS Account_ and (usually) only have access to resources
  within that account

As we'll see later, there are special kinds of users you can create that _do have an email address_
and can access resources in multiple AWS Accounts. These are created through AWS SSO.

IAM Users can have permissions (policies, see below) that dictate what they can and cannot do on
AWS. These permissions are used to allow/deny access to AWS services and resources.

Users usually represent humans but can also represent software and machines _outside of AWS_ that
you want to give programmatic access to certain AWS services and resources through the AWS API.
If you want to grant software running _inside_ AWS access to other AWS services and resources, you
can use **Roles**.

### IAM Roles

A **Role** in IAM is similar to a User in that it is an Identity with permissions that determine
what it can and cannot do within AWS. The difference with a User is that a Role is not tied to a
specific human or machine. Instead, a role can be **assumed** by users or AWS services to
temporarily gain access to certain AWS services and/or resources.

Roles do not have permanent login/API credentials. Instead, a role provides temporary credentials
when the role is assumed.

### IAM Groups

In IAM, **Groups** are used to group Users together so the same permissions (_policies_, see below)
can be applied to multiple Users at once.

## Granting and Denying Access: Policies

Now that we have established that we have _Resources_<Asterisk content="Infrastructure you can rent from AWS" />
and _Identities_<Asterisk content="Users, Roles and Groups" /> that can potentially access those
Resources, how exactly do we determine _who_ can access _what_?

This is done through **Policies**. In IAM, Policies are basically _permissions_ on _resources_

A policy defines access (or denial) to an AWS service and/or resource. There are 2 types of policies:

- **Identity-based policy**: this policy is attached to a certain _Identity_ to allow/deny this identity access to one or more Resources
- **Resource-based policy**: this policy is attached to a _Resource_ to define access to that Resource

A policy contains the following elements:

- **Effect**: should we _allow_ or _deny_ something?
- **Resource**: what do we want to control access to?
- **Action**: what action is allowed/denied?
- **Principal**: who should be allowed/denied access?

The _Principal_ is only specified in the case of Resource-based policies. That makes sense if you
think about it, because in the case of Identity-based policies, the Principal is the Identity itself
the policy is attached to!

### Example: identity-based policy

Let's say that we want to give IAM User _kiara_ access to read all files in the `confidential-data`
S3 bucket. What would the Effect, Resource and Action look like for our policy? The policy would
look something like this:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:List*",
    "s3:Get*"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data",
    "arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data/*"
  ]
}
```

This policy would then be attached to the IAM User _kiara_ to grant her access.

### It's a matter of Principal

As mentioned before, for Identity-based policies, you don't need to specify a Principal. But what
exactly _is_ a Principal? Is it the same as an _Identity_? It turns out it's more than that:

A Principal is an AWS identity **or Service**. To understand why services can be used as Principal,
we have to understand where Principals are specified, which is in 2 places:

- In a Resource-based policy, the principal determines _who_ can access the resource the policy is attached to
- In a Role, the principal determines who (what Identity) can assume the role

When specifying a Principal in a Role, we can say that instead of allowing a regular (human) User
to assume the Role, we can allow an AWS Service (e.g. AWS Lambda) to assume the role for us. An
example of how this can be useful: we could allow a function run on AWS Lambda to send a message on
an SNS topic for us whenever something important happens during its execution. To do this, we would
create a special Role for this Lambda function with a Policy attached that would allow this Role
to publish messages on an SNS topic. Then we would allow AWS Lambda to assume this Role.

### Resource-based policies

What is perhaps counter-intuitive, is that _Identity-based policies_ are more common than
_Resource-based policies_ for defining access to resources. The common way of doing things, is to
attach policies to Identities to specify what _Resources_ they have access to and in what ways.

Part of the reason is that Resource-based policies are not supported by all services and
resource-types in AWS, whereas you can use any Resource identifier in an Identity-based polity.

**So in what situations are Resource-based policies being used?**

Resource-based policies are often used when you want to grant an Identity **outside your AWS
account** access to a Resource in your AWS account. To understand how this works, let's assume the
following scenario:

- There are 2 AWS Accounts: Account A (managed by Company A) and Account B (managed by Company B)
- Account A has a special Resource: S3 bucket `secret-stuff`
- Company A wants to grant Company B access to the `secret-stuff` bucket
- Company B decides that they want to use User X to access the `secret-stuff` bucket that Company A
  as granted them access to

To make this happen you have to do 2 things:

1. **Allow access from AWS Account B to a specific Resource** (the `secret-stuff` bucket): on the
   aforementioned S3 bucket, we would create a _Resource-based policy_ that has _AWS Account B_ as
   principal
2. **Allow access from a specific Identity in Account B to a specific Resource in Account A**: on
   the _IAM User X_ that we want to grant access to, we would create an _Identity-based policy_ to
   grant access specifically to the `secret-stuff` bucket, which happens to live in AWS Account A.

What is interesting here, is that Company A would have no say in exactly what _Identity_ is used
by Company B -- in AWS Account B -- to access their resource. The only thing they would control, is
the fact that AWS Account B can access their resource in AWS Account A. It is Account B where it is
determined exactly what Identity gets to access the `secret-stuff` bucket.

## IAM with multiple AWS Accounts: Organizations

As explained in the [previous blog post](/aws-multi-account), you can leverage AWS Organizations to
group multiple AWS Accounts together to consolidate billing but also access control.

How does IAM work in the context of AWS Organizations? This happens through 2 additional concepts:

- AWS SSO Users & Groups
- Permission sets

### AWS SSO

AWS Single Sign-on lets you define Users and Groups in a central place -- usually in the
_management account_ of your AWS Organization -- and control access to resources in all AWS Accounts
in an Organization for those Users and Groups.

**SSO Users** have a few fundamental differences compared to regular IAM users:

- SSO Users have an email address to identify them
- SSO Users usually have access to resources in _multiple_ AWS Accounts
- SSO Users don't have (Identity-based) policies attached directly to them

**SSO Groups** are similar to IAM Groups in that they're used to group together Users so that the
same policies can be applied to all users within a group. A key difference here is that -- just
like with SSO Users -- policies are not attached to SSO Groups directly.

If you cannot attach policies to SSO Users & Groups directly, how can you allow those Users & Groups
access to resources in the AWS Accounts in your Organization? This is done through
**Permission Sets**.

### Permission Sets

Permission Sets are basically the AWS SSO alternative to regular IAM Policies. They are set up in a
very similar way -- with Effects, Actions and Resources. The big difference is that Permission Sets
are not applied to an SSO User/Group alone, but they are applied in combination with an AWS Account.

**A Permission Set is applied to an SSO User/Group for a _specific AWS Account_**

This means that when you apply a Permission Set to an SSO User/Group, you choose an AWS Account so
that the policies defined in the Permission Set are applied to the SSO User/Group _for the selected
AWS Account_.

Example: let's say you have created a Permission Set that allows read-only access to all resources.
Now you can grant `kiara@examplecorp.com` read access to all resources in Account A in your
Organization by applying the aforementioned Permission Set to `kiara@examplecorp.com` _specifically_
for Account A.

Permission Sets encourage reuse of similar policies across AWS Accounts and SSO Users.

### How AWS applies access control in SSO

If you apply a Permission Set to an SSO User for a specific AWS Account, how does that work
internally? In the end, AWS will still use IAM to do the actual access management. For each
Permission Set you apply to a certain AWS Account -- for 1 or more SSO Users/Groups -- AWS will
create a dedicated Role in that AWS Account. Let's say that in the example above where we want to
grant _read-only_ access, we called the Permission Set `ReadOnlyPermissions`. When we apply this
Permission Set to Account A for `kiara@examplecorp.com`, AWS will do 3 things:

- It will create a Role in Account A based on the `ReadOnlyPermissions` Permission Set
- It will attach policies to that Role according to the policies defined in the `ReadOnlyPermissions`
  Permission Set
- It will add `kiara@examplecorp.com` as Principal to the created Role so she can assume that Role
  in Account A

Now when `kiara@examplecorp.com` logs into AWS using SSO, she will be presented with a choice to
assume the `ReadOnlyPermissions` Role in Account A -- next to all the other Roles she can assume
in the same or other AWS Accounts in the Organization, all based on the Permission Sets applied
to her for specific Accounts.

## Conclusion

When I started writing this post, I hoped it would be concise. I guess I failed a bit on that
account, which just goes to show how complex AWS IAM really is. I still hope that this gives you an
overview that is easier to digest than reading through pages of AWS documentation.
